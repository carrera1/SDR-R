__Interacting with SDR-R via USB__

The SDR-R is implemented on the Digilent cmod-a7 FPGA developmental board. Serial communication is accomplished over the onboard FTDI USB-UART bridge. If your platform is anything but Linux, you will need to manually download and install the FTDI VCP driver [available here](https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm)
